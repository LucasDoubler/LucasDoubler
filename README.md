My name is Lucas, and I am currently a junior college student. I have a strong interest in embedded development and plan to work in this field in the future. I love photography and digital equipment.

### Smart home project
- I am currently developing a smart home system that monitors the environment in each room of the house through a terminal with a touch screen, and remotely operates peripherals in each room.
- The project involves sensor data acquisition, processing and display, implementation of remote control peripherals, design of user interface, etc.

## Future planning
After graduation, I plan to find a job as an embedded software developer. After four to five years of industry experience accumulation and capital reserve, I will strive to start my own company at the age of 30.
